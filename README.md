Where RU Professor ?
====================
Have you ever needed to talk to a Rutgers professor who:
- you are not currently taking a class with
- is not responding to your emails
- has no office hours
    
If yes, your alternate option is to visit this professor after a class he/she teaches. The only way to
figure this out is by browsing through the Rutgers Schedule of Classes. No one want to do that! This app
does it for you. It will look through all courses and list when and where the given professor teaches.

Be aware! If you use the 'All' option it might take a few minutes to look through all the courses!
